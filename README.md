# Minesweeper
CSCE 121 Team Project



So heres what we need next:
1. add logic for checking other squares
2. add shift+d for debug mode
  - use a handle event in board
3. figure out in stream for images 
4. get new game button

For Milestone Demo on Moday we need:

1. Grid of tiles displayed in window.
2. Image on a tile changes when right clicked.
3. Debug mode can be turned on and off and indicates where mines are located when on.
4. New game results in a different ordering of mines as demonstrated with debug mode.
5. Change game board size.
6.
