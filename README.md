# Minesweeper
CSCE 121 Team Project

For Milestone Demo on Moday we need:

1. Grid of tiles displayed in window.
2. Image on a tile changes when right clicked.
3. Debug mode can be turned on and off and indicates where mines are located when on.
4. New game results in a different ordering of mines as demonstrated with debug mode.
5. Change game board size.
